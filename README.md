# Hey! I'm William ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hey! I'm William, a Junior double majoring in Business Administration and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics and Analytics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Captivated by the dynamic fields of corporate strategy, financial analysis, and organizational leadership and fascinated by the unique challenges that stem from leveraging technology to drive innovation, I harbor a passion for applying the skills at the intersection of these evolving fields.

When I'm not in the classroom or at my computer, you can find me in the gym weightlifting, in the kitchen finding new dishes to cook, outside in nature taking photos, or exploring wherever my heart takes me. 

Feel free to explore some of my projects, if you'd like to talk or even grab a cup of coffee, reach out to me at william_wang@kenan-flagler.unc.edu!

Thank you for visiting!
