# Hey! I'm William ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is William, and I'm a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I'm passionate about iOS development, Project management, and the wide range of disciplines I can use in Computer Science. I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. 

Feel free to explore some of my projects, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!

Thank you for visiting!
