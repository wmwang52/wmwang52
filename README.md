# Hey! I'm Will

I'm Will Wang â€” a Senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, double majoring in **Business Administration (Entrepreneurship/Consulting)** and **Computer Science** with a minor in **Statistics and Analytics**.  

Iâ€™m passionate about building solutions at the intersection of technology, business, and strategy â€” whether thatâ€™s developing scalable mobile applications, driving product innovation, or leading teams to deliver software with real-world impact. With experience in both corporate and startup settings, I enjoy bridging technical execution with strategic decision-making.
